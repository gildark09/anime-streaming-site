Phase 2: Anime API Integration
Step 3: Research and Integrate Consumet API
Familiarize Yourself with the API

Review the Consumet API documentation to understand the endpoints.
Create API Service

Create a service file (e.g., services/animeService.js) in the backend to handle API requests.
Implement Caching Mechanism (Optional)

Consider using Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data.
Develop Metadata Parsing

Write functions to parse and format the whered from the API.
Phase 3: Frontend Development

Step 4: Build Core Features
Home Page with Trending Anime

Create a Home component and fetch trending anime data using the API service.
Detailed Anime Information Page

Create a Detail component to display more information about selected anime.
Video Streaming Player

Integrate a video player component that uses the streaming links from the API.
Search Functionality

Implement a search bar and connect it to the API to fetch results based on user input.
Genre and Category Filtering

Create filters and update the displayed anime based on selected genres.
Phase 4: User Experience Features
Step 5: Enhance User Experience
Favorites/Watchlist

Create a basic feature to allow users to save their favorite anime.
Recommendation System (Optional)

Implement a simple recommendation algorithm based on user preferences.

Phase 5: Performance and Optimization
Step 6: Optimize Application
Implement Lazy Loading

Use dynamic imports for components and lazy load images and videos.
Optimize API Calls

Reduce the number of API calls and implement efficient data fetching.
Phase 6: Security Enhancements
Step 7: Secure Your Application
Implement Rate Limiting

Use middleware like express-rate-limit to prevent abuse.
Secure API Endpoints

Ensure that sensitive endpoints are protected.

Phase 7: Deployment
Step 8: Prepare for Deployment (continued)

Dockerize Your Application (Optional)

Create Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend.
Set Up CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)
Choose a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and create a configuration file to automate the build and deployment process for both frontend and backend.
Example for GitHub Actions:
yaml

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install Frontend Dependencies
        run: |
          cd frontend
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Install Backend Dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend
          npm install

      - name: Deploy Frontend
        run: |
          # Add commands to deploy to Netlify/Vercel
          # Example for Netlify:
          npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir=frontend/dist

      - name: Deploy Backend
        run: |
          # Add commands to deploy to Heroku/DigitalOcean
          # Example for Heroku:
          git push heroku main
Deploy Frontend

Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and follow their deployment instructions.
For example, with Netlify:
bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy
Deploy Backend

Choose a cloud hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean) and follow their deployment instructions.
For Heroku:
bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
Configure SSL Certificates

Ensure that your deployed applications use HTTPS. Most hosting platforms provide automatic SSL certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt).
Set Up Database Hosting (if needed)

If using MongoDB, consider using a cloud database service like MongoDB Atlas. Set up your database and update your connection string in the .env file.
Final Steps
Step 9: Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit Testing

Write unit tests for your components and API endpoints using testing libraries like Jest or Mocha.
Example for Vue components:
bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
npm install --save-dev @vue/test-utils jest
Integration Testing

Test the interaction between different parts of your application to ensure they work together correctly.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Gather feedback from users to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
Step 10: Documentation
Code Documentation

Comment your code and use tools like JSDoc to generate documentation for your API and components.
User Documentation

Create a README.md file that includes instructions on how to set up, run, and use the application.
API Documentation

Use tools like Swagger or Postman to document your API endpoints.
Future Roadmap Extensions
Mobile App Development

Consider building a mobile version of your application using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
Offline Viewing Capabilities

Implement service workers to cache content for offline access.
Advanced Recommendation System

Use machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior.
Community Features

Add forums, chat functionalities, or user profiles to foster community engagement.
